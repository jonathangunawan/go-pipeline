# iPhone Factory

We will try to simulate how iPhone Factory works, as you know is common practice that any factory in the world use assembly line that developed by Henry

Let's imagine that iPhone Factory will have 4 step

1. Take iPhone body and put serial number on it
2. Install the display, battery into the body
3. Check functionality (2s)
4. Pack the iPhone
5. Wrap multiple iPhone into 1 Big box that can contain 100 iPhone (only 1 person can handle this, to make sure there big box will be fully filled first then take another big box)
